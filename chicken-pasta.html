<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> What I love about this garlic chicken pasta recipe is you can literally use any kind of pasta that you like. I typically alter my recipe, depending on what kind of pasta I found on sale.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Normally, I use a combination of garlic powder, Italian seasoning, paprika, salt, and pepper to add more flavor to this dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> You want a good quality olive oil to cook the chicken in.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> The butter helps cook the garlic and adds to the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> For best results, use minced garlic. I stick around to four cloves for this recipe, but you could always add in more or less depending on what you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> The tomatoes enhance the way the chicken pasta looks, but it also makes it taste extra hearty and delicious.</li>
        <li><strong>Spinach:</strong> Spinach gives you a boost in vitamins and minerals. You can leave it out if you want to, but I love the flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy cream:</strong> The real star of the show is the heavy cream! It gives this chicken pasta a creamy texture that is crave-worthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan cheese:</strong> You can’t really have an Italian dish without some Parmesan cheese, right?</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You’ll need to start off by preparing the pasta according to the package directions. You want to cook it till it’s al dente and not overly cooked.</li>
        <li>Then you’ll take the seasonings and add it to both sides of the chicken breast.</li>
        <li>Warm up the olive oil in a heavy-duty pan using medium-high heat. Once it’s hot, add the chicken breast and cook them for 5 minutes on each side or until it’s cooked all the way through. After the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Using the same pan, add in the garlic and butter. Sautee for 1 minute or until the garlic is fragrant. Then add in the diced tomato and fresh spinach. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until the spinach has wilted and the tomatoes have softened.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat and add in the heavy cream along with the parmesan cheese. Use a whisk and stir until it is fully incorporated in creamy. Add in a little bit of salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and slice up the chicken into thin slices. Place them in both in the pan and stir well. Serve, and enjoy!</li>
